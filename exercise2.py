# Create an `Hotel` class.  
# `Hotel` objects need to have a name, a location, and a number of residents (on initialization, this number should be automatically set to 0).  
# Create two functions `check_in` and `check_out` that will be ran when someone enters/leaves the hotel. Those functions should modify the number of current residents.  
# If a person try to enter an hotel that is already full, tell him gently that you won't be able to host him.
