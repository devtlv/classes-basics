# Add a `current_fuel` and a `fuel_capacity` attribute to your `Car` class from exercise 1, and add a function `fuel_car`. Every liter of gas cost 2$, the `fuel_car` function should return the cost of the operation you just made (Bonus: You can also add a limit to the gas cost as an argument).  
# Now add a `fuel_cost` attribute that represents the amount of gas your car need to spend to travel 1km, then add a `travel` function that receives a number of kilometers and simulate a travel.  
# If the car runs out of gas then.. too bad for the user.
